Initial Build for Digital Edition of Marx's Capital Vol.1

MARXdown is an online digital reading edition developed for the Contemporary Marxist Reading Group (CMRG) at Carnegie Mellon University using the lightweight markup language Markdown. Designed to support group annotation of key texts for our group and others, it provides a centralized and accessible online space for ongoing critical engagement between readers and materials related to the study of Marxist theory.

This reading edition of Marx’s Capital Volume 1 was created using Ed. and hypothes.is, and draws its source text from www.marxists.org.

Ed. is a Jekyll theme designed for textual editors based on minimal computing principles, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. “Ed.” was developed by Susanna Allés Torrent, Terry Catapano, Alex Gil, and Johann Gillium.

hypothes.is is an open-source software platform that fosters community-building by using annotation to enable sentence-level note taking, comments, and replies layered on top of websites. Like hypothes.is, we use annotation standards for digital documents developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group.
