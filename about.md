MARXdown develops minimal reading editions of texts important for reconsidering contemporary Marxist theory, which are readable, multi-layered, and public. Our goal is to cooperate together with others in creating critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological studies, in easily accessible, user-friendly interfaces to which anyone may contribute.

## How it Works

MARXdown is built based on [minimal computing principles](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/), using a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and a theme designed for textual editors called "[Ed](https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/)."

The site enables a conversation layer with help from [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/about/), which was based on the annotation standards for digital documents developed by the [W3C Web Annotation Working Group](https://www.w3.org/annotation/).

**MARXdown is free, non-profit, and open source.**
