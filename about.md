title: About Us

MARXdown is interested in creating lightweight, minimal reading editions of key Marxist texts that are multi-layered, legible, and held in common. Our goal is to cooperate together to create critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological studies, in easily accessible and user-friendly interfaces to which anyone may contribute.

##  How We're Doing It

MARXdown is built using an extendable, static site generator called Jekyll, and a theme designed by for textual editors called Ed. It incorporates a conversation layer over the site with help from hypothes.is, which was developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group.
