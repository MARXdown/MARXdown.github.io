**VOLUME 1** is an online digital edition of the first volume of Karl Marx’s *Das Kapital*.


First published over 150 years ago, volume one of *Capital* on "The Process of Production of Capital" has endured as an important touchstone for scholars across diverse fields in the humanities and social sciences, as well as for activists and intellectuals of all types with an interest in the experience and conditions of life under capitalism. Marx's radical vision of the social consequences of modern industrial development has had controversial and far-reaching effects in global politics and thought.


This digital edition brings together the original English translation from 1887 with extant scholarly sources to create a multi-layered annotated edition of the text providing critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological data in one easily accessible and user-friendly interface.

**VOLUME 1** was built using *Ed.* + *hypothes.is*

## Ed. -  A Jekyll Theme for Minimal Editions
One of our most pressing and ever revolving needs as scholars is to pass on our textual artifacts from one generation to another. The art of textual editing, among other practices, has helped many cultures to remember and interpret for centuries. Alas, that art is practiced and encouraged in its highest form by a dwindling number of scholars. In a digital environment the problem is compounded by the difficulties of the medium. While vast repositories, and "e-publications" appear on the online scene yearly, very few manifest a textual scholar's disciplined attention to detail. In contrast, most textual scholars who have made the leap to a rigorous digital practice have focused on markup, relying on technical teams to deploy and maintain their work. This makes your average scholarly digital edition a very costly, and therefore limited affair.

As we see it, a minimal edition is one that aims to reduce the size and complexity of the back and front end, and the learning curves for the user and the producer. Out of-the-box, this theme can help you build a simple reading edition, or a traditional scholarly edition with footnotes and a bibliography without breaking the bank. In our estimate, these are the two most immediately useful type of editions for editors and readers. An edition produced with Ed consists of static pages whose rate of decay is substantially lower than database-driven systems. As an added bonus, these static pages require less bandwith. Our hope is that our approach can help beginners or veterans deploy beautiful editions with less effort, that it can help us teach a 'full stack' in one academic semester, allow us to care for our projects at less cost, and perhaps, just perhaps, allow us to generate high-quality editions on github.io in large quantities based on the [git-lit](http://jonreeve.com/2015/09/introducing-git-lit/) model by Jonathan Reeve. We're coming for you, Kindle!

## hypothes.is

The Hypothesis Project is a new effort to implement an old idea: A conversation layer over the entire web that works everywhere, without needing implementation by any underlying site.

Our team creates open source software, pushes for standards, and fosters community.

Using annotation, we enable sentence-level note taking or critique on top of news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and more. Everything we build is guided by our principles. In particular that it be free, open, non-profit, neutral and lasting to name a few.

We are a non-profit organization, funded through the generosity of sponsors like the Knight, Mellon, Shuttleworth, Sloan, Helmsley, and Omidyar Foundations—and through the support of thousands of individuals like yourself that want to see this idea come to fruition. You can donate to our effort, or view our tax returns.

Our efforts are based on the annotation standards for digital documents developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group. We are partnering broadly with developers, publishers, academic institutions, researchers, and individuals to develop a platform for the next generation of read-write web applications. You can follow our development progress on our roadmap. Many have contributed tools, plug-ins and integrations.
