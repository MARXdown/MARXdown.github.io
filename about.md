**MARXdown** is a collection of online reading editions designed to support the group annotation of key texts related to the study of contemporary Marxist theory. Published over 150 years ago, our first edition is Vol. 1 of Karl Marx's *Das Kapital*. "The Process of Production of Capital" has endured as an important touchstone for many people across diverse fields in the humanities and social sciences, as well as for activists and intellectuals of all types with an interest in the experience and conditions of life under capitalism.

**Marx's radical vision of the social consequences of modern industrial development has had controversial and far-reaching effects in global politics and thought.**

This edition of *Capital Vol. 1* brings together the original English translation from 1887 (drawn from [www.marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Capital-Volume-I.pdf)) with annotations and extant scholarly sources to create a multi-layered edition of the text that is held in common. It aims to be a critical reading guide and supplemental historical and sociological study, in one easily accessible and user-friendly interface to which anyone may contribute.

**MARXdown** was built using *Ed.* + *hypothes.is*
