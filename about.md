MARXdown is interested in creating minimal reading editions of important texts that are readable, multi-layered, and public. Our goal is to cooperate together to create critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological studies, in easily accessible and user-friendly interfaces to which anyone may contribute.

## How it Works

MARXdown was built using a static site generator called Jekyll and a theme designed for textual editors called "Ed."

Developed by Alex Gil and others, Ed is based on minimal computing principals and focuses on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. MARXdown incorporates a conversation layer over the site with help from hypothes.is, which was developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group.

**MARXdown is free, non-profit, and open source.**
