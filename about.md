**MARXdown** is a collection of online reading editions designed to support the layered group annotation of key texts related to the study of contemporary Marxist theory.

Our goal is to build light weight, minimal editions of texts that are accessible, legible, and held in common. Each edition aims to be a critical reading guide and supplemental historical and sociological study, in one easily accessible and user-friendly interface to which anyone may contribute.

Published over 150 years ago, our first edition is Vol. 1 of Karl Marx's *Das Kapital*. "The Process of Production of Capital" has endured as an important touchstone for many in the humanities and social sciences, as well as for activists and intellectuals of all types with an interest in the experience and conditions of life under capitalism.

**Marx's radical vision of the social consequences of modern industrial development has had controversial and far-reaching effects in global politics and thought.**

This edition of *Capital Vol. 1* brings together the original English translation from 1887 (drawn from [www.marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Capital-Volume-I.pdf)) with public annotations and links to extant scholarly sources.
