MARXdown is interested in developing minimal reading editions of texts important for reconsidering contemporary Marxist theory that are readable, multi-layered, and public. Our goal is to cooperate together with others in creating critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological studies, in easily accessible, user-friendly interfaces to which anyone may contribute.

## How it Works

MARXdown is built on [minimal computing principles](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/){:target="_blank"}, using a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and a theme designed for textual editors called "[Ed](https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/){:target="_blank"}." Ed is designed by Susanna All√©s Torrent, Terry Catapano, Alex Gil, and Johann Gillium.

The site enables a conversation layer with help from [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/about/){:target="_blank"}, which is based on the annotation standards for digital documents developed by the [W3C Web Annotation Working Group](https://www.w3.org/annotation/){:target="_blank"}.

**MARXdown is free, non-profit, and open source.**
