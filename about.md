MARXdown is interested in creating minimal reading editions of texts important for reconsidering contemporary Marxist theory, which are readable, multi-layered, and public. Our goal is to cooperate together with others in creating critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological studies, in easily accessible and user-friendly interfaces to which anyone may contribute.

## How it Works

MARXdown was built using a static site generator called Jekyll and a theme designed for textual editors called "Ed." Based on minimal computing principals. Ed focuses on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility.

The site enables a conversation layer with help from hypothes.is, which was developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group.

**MARXdown is free, non-profit, and open source.**
