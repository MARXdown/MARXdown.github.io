**MARXdown is built using an extendable, static site generator called Jekyll. We give it plain text written in the markup language Markdown, and it generates a static website hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

We also use a Jekyll theme called "Ed," which was developed for textual editors. Designed by Alex Gil and others in NYC, Ed is based on minimal computing principles and it focuses on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility

Lastly, the conversation layer over the top of the site is hypothes.is. The hypothes.is project enables sentence-level note taking and critique across the web. Developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group, hypothes.is is free, non-profit, and open source.**
