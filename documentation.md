### Annotating the Text: Getting Started

* **Step 1**: Sign up for a free [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/about/) account by clicking [here](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)
* **Step 2**: Learn how to easily annotate reading editions on MARXdown using your hypothes.is account by clicking [here](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/).
* **Step 3**: Review and save our style guide before you post your first annotation or reply.
* **Step 4**: It's time to read a couple annotations! Navigate to Ch. 1 in the reading edition of *Capital Vol. 1* on [MARXdown](https://marxdown.github.io/texts/ch01/), open the hypothes.is tab in the upper right, and scroll to see extant "Public" annotations.
* **Step 5**: Start annotating! Or read and reply to an existing annotation, with the goal of contributing to a cooperative, media-layered edition of Marx's text.
