MARXdown is built using a simple, extendable, static site generator called Jekyll. We give it plain text written in the markup language Markdown, and it generates a static website hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

Jekyll also has an extensive theme system. We use a theme designed by Alex Gil for textual editors called Ed. Based on minimal computing principals, Ed focuses on focuses on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility.

 We implement a conversation layer over the site using hypothes.is, which enables sentence-level note taking and critique. Developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group, it is free, non-profit, and open source.
