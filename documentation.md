**Getting Started with Annotating the Text**

* **Step 1**: [Sign up for a free hypothes.is account by clicking here](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)

* **Step 2**: [Learn how to easily annotate reading editions on MARXdown using your hypothes.is account by clicking here](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/).

* **Step 3**: [Review and save our style guide before you post your first annotation or reply](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14hfh7E9KhtJHpYjst5-CMwGYY_kEFJtXUpmQSema5Zs/edit?usp=sharing).

* **Step 4**: It's time to read a couple annotations! [Navigate to Ch. 1 in the reading edition of *Capital Vol. 1* on MARXdown](https://marxdown.github.io/texts/ch01/), open the hypothes.is tab in the upper right, and scroll to see extant "Public" annotations.

* **Step 5**: Start annotating! Or read and reply to an existing annotation, with the goal of contributing to a cooperative, media-layered edition of Marx's text.


##  How We're Doing It

MARXdown is built using an extendable, static site generator called Jekyll, using a theme designed by for textual editors called Ed. It incorporates a conversation layer over the site with help from hypothes.is, which was developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group.

**MARXdown is free, non-profit, and open source.**
