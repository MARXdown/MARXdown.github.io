We're interested in building light weight, minimal reading editions of key  texts with the goal of being accessible, legible, and held in common. Help to create a critical reading guide and supplemental historical and sociological study, in one easily accessible and user-friendly interface to which anyone may contribute.

**Getting Started with Annotating the Text**

* **Step 1**: Sign up for a free [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/about/) account by clicking [here](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)

* **Step 2**: Learn how to easily annotate reading editions on MARXdown using your hypothes.is account by clicking [here](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/).

* **Step 3**: Review and save our style guide before you post your first annotation or reply.

* **Step 4**: It's time to read a couple annotations! Navigate to Ch. 1 in the reading edition of *Capital Vol. 1* on [MARXdown](https://marxdown.github.io/texts/ch01/), open the hypothes.is tab in the upper right, and scroll to see extant "Public" annotations.

* **Step 5**: Start annotating! Or read and reply to an existing annotation, with the goal of contributing to a cooperative, media-layered edition of Marx's text.

##  What It's Doing

MARXdown is built using an extendable, static site generator called Jekyll, using a theme designed by for textual editors called Ed. It incorporates a conversation layer over the site with help from hypothes.is, which was developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group. MARXdown is free, non-profit, and open source.
