**MARXdown is a collection of online reading editions initially developed for the Contemporary Marxist Reading Group at Carnegie Mellon University using the lightweight markup language Markdown.** 

 Our first edition is the 1887 English translation of Karl Marx’s *Capital Vol. 1* and draws its source text from [www.marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Capital-Volume-I.pdf).

### [Capital Vol.1 - Karl Marx]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cap1index.md %})
Published over 150 years ago, our first edition is Vol. 1 of Karl Marx's *Das Kapital*. "The Process of Production of Capital" has endured as an important touchstone for many in the humanities and social sciences, as well as for activists and intellectuals of all types with an interest in the experience and conditions of life under capitalism.
