LETTER TO FREDERICK ENGELS


16 August 1867 2 a.m.

"Dear Fred,

Have just finished correcting the _last sheet_ (49th) of
the book. ... So, _this volume is finished._ I owe it to _you_
alone that it was possible! Without your self-sacrifice for me I could
not possibly have managed the immense labour demanded by the 3 volumes.
I embrace you, full of thanks! ...

Salut, my dear, valued friend.

K. Marx."
